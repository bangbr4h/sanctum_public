# SANCTUM Framework (Public Release)

**SANCTUM** is an offline, persona-driven AI runtime framework focused on privacy, modular design, and emotional continuity. This public release includes core scaffolding for persistent memory, daemon monitoring, and future expansion into vectorized semantic recall.

> Note: This version omits all proprietary or emotionally-sensitive logic tied to the personality layer.
